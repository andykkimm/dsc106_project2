      <h2>Proposition: Black individuals are disproportionately the subjects of police misconduct allegations compared to their representation in the general population.</h2>

        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

          <figcaption>Comparison of the racial distribution of police misconduct allegations versus the general population in New York City. Black individuals account for a substantially higher proportion of allegations relative to their share of the overall population, suggesting disproportionate representation among subjects of police misconduct complaints.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Data Preparation and Accuracy: </strong>We filtered the dataset to include only relevant columns (complainant ethnicity, gender, allegation type, precinct, and disposition) and excluded low or missing values to ensure accurate and unbiased comparisons between ethnic groups.</li>
          <li><strong>External Benchmarking: </strong>Population proportions were gathered from the 2020 NYC Census to provide a fair baseline for comparison against the allegation data, allowing disparities to be evaluated in context.</li>
          <li><strong>Visualization Choice: </strong>A side-by-side bar chart was selected to clearly display Allegations (%) vs. Population (%) by race, making over- and underrepresentation immediately visible and emphasizing evidence of racial disparity.</li>
        </ul>
