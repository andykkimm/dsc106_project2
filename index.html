        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

          <figcaption>Comparison of the racial distribution of police misconduct allegations versus the general population in New York City. Black individuals account for a substantially higher proportion of allegations relative to their share of the overall population, suggesting disproportionate representation among subjects of police misconduct complaints.</figcaption>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <strong>Decision 1 – Data Cleaning and Selection (Score: +2, Earnest)</strong><br>
            We filtered the dataset to include only relevant columns such as <code>complainant_ethnicity</code>, <code>allegation</code>, and <code>board_disposition</code>, and removed missing or low-frequency entries. This ensures the visualization accurately reflects racial distribution without distortion. This choice is fully earnest since it prioritizes data integrity and transparency.
          <strong>Decision 2 – Using NYC 2020 Census as a Baseline (Score: +1.5, Earnest)</strong><br>
            We compared allegation proportions with population proportions from the 2020 NYC Census to contextualize disparities. This helps viewers understand over- and underrepresentation relative to the city’s demographics. While this introduces an external dataset (which might have minor temporal mismatch), it’s still largely earnest because it strengthens interpretability and fairness.          <li><strong>Visualization Choice: </strong>A side-by-side bar chart was selected to clearly display Allegations (%) vs. Population (%) by race, making over- and underrepresentation immediately visible and emphasizing evidence of racial disparity.</li>
          <strong>Decision 3 – Side-by-Side Bar Chart Comparison (Score: +1.5, Earnest)</strong><br>
            We used grouped bars to compare Allegations (%) and Population (%) by race. This layout makes it easy to visually identify which groups are disproportionately represented. The clear visual contrast supports the proposition effectively while maintaining honesty — no scale manipulation or exaggeration is used. Alternative options (like stacked bars) were less direct and harder to interpret.
